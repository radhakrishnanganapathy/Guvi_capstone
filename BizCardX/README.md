<!-- # To find and extract names from a group of sentences, you can use Named Entity Recognition (NER) which is a part of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Libraries such as spaCy or NLTK provide pre-trained models that can recognize names (PERSON entities) in a text.

Install spaCy and download the language model --> pip install spacy 
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm -->
